# Plant-Monitor
CASA0014 Assessment
//step by step set up of the plant monitor
I am given an opportunity to look after Asparagus 'Fern' setaceus. Plant requires damp soil (not waterlogged - not dry)
bright light but not direct sunlight 
Plant monitor will monitor the soil moisture over a period of several months (at least 6 months) 
The monitor needs to be coded to be able to collect data, show it MQTT and save the data (locally and remotely)
